# Laura Modiano

## Snapshot
- Current role: Startups EMEA lead/head at OpenAI.
- Focus area: Startup ecosystem development across EMEA (VCs, accelerators, startup teams, developer community).
- Prior background: AWS startup/VC partnerships, healthcare/life sciences startup programs, consulting and health/data/AI partnership roles.

## Relevant Context For Judging
Laura appears to sit at the intersection of frontier AI capability and startup execution in EMEA. She is likely strong on:
- Product-market fit signals in early AI startups.
- GTM realism, partnership leverage, and founder velocity.
- Founder quality, ecosystem strategy, and scaling readiness.

## Practical Pitch Strategy
- Lead with the business problem and measurable user impact first.
- Show how your team uses OpenAI models as a moat, not as a thin wrapper.
- Be specific about distribution and expansion strategy (who buys, why now, and why you).
