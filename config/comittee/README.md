## Verification Pass (February 5, 2026)
- Reviewed all 15 judge notes for role freshness, evidence quality, and source robustness.
- Added `last_verified: 2026-02-05` and `verification_basis: public-signals-only` across all judge notes.
- Hardened source sets for three identity-constrained profiles: Hannah Koch, Daniel Steigman, and Francis Greenleaf.

### Confidence Rollup
- High confidence: Laura Modiano, Ed Bayes, Charlie Weems, Fouad Matin, Charlie Guo, Dave Leo, Celia Chen, Greg Brockman, Tibo Sottiaux, Sonya Huang, Lenny Rachitsky, Peter Steinberger.
- Medium confidence (`needs-verification`): Hannah Koch, Daniel Steigman, Francis Greenleaf.

## Notes On Verification
- First-party OpenAI Cookbook and podcast sources strongly anchor Charlie Weems, Dave Leo, and Tibo Sottiaux.
- Hannah Koch, Francis Greenleaf, and Daniel Steigman remain medium confidence and are explicitly marked `needs-verification` for identity-safe personalization.
